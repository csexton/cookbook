  title: Shells with Crispy Pancetta and Spinach
  ingredients: |
    Shells: 
    1 (12-ounce) package jumbo shells pasta 
    2 tablespoons olive oil 
    1/2 pound thick-cut pancetta, cut into 3/4-inch cubes 
    2 pounds frozen spinach, thawed and drained 
    1 (15-ounce) container whole milk ricotta 
    1 cup grated asiago cheese 
    1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
    1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 
    Sauce: 
    1 tablespoon butter 
    1 garlic clove, minced 
    1 cup cream 
    2 cups grated asiago cheese, plus 1/4 cup 
    1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley 
    1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
    

  directions: |
    Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. 
    For the shells: 
    Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the pasta and cook until tender but still firm to the bite, stirring occasionally, about 8 to 10 minutes. Drain pasta. 
    
    Warm the olive oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium heat. Add the pancetta and cook until lightly golden, about 5 minutes. Remove the pancetta from the pan with a slotted spoon and transfer to a large bowl. Add the spinach, ricotta cheese, asiago cheese, pepper, and nutmeg. Stir to combine. Stuff the shells with about 2 tablespoons of the spinach mixture each and place the stuffed shells in a large, buttered baking dish. 
    
    For the sauce: 
    Melt the butter in a medium saucepan. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add the cream and bring to a simmer. Turn the heat to very low and add the 2 cups asiago cheese, parsley, and pepper. Stir until the cheese is dissolved. Pour the sauce over the shells. Top with the remaining 1/4 cup asiago cheese. Bake until golden on top, about 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and serve immediately.

  ingredients: |-
    3 ounces (6 tablespoons) butter, chilled
    1 ounce (2 tablespoons) lard, chilled
    6 ounces (approximately 1 cup) all-purpose flour, plus extra for rolling dough
    1/2 teaspoon table salt
    1/4 cup ice water, in spritz bottle
    Approximately 32 ounces of dried beans, for blind baking
  directions: |-
    Place butter and lard in freezer for 15 minutes. When ready to use, remove and cut both into small pieces.
    
    In the bowl of a food processor, combine flour and salt by pulsing 3 to 4 times. Add butter and pulse 5 to 6 times until texture looks mealy. Add lard and pulse another 3 to 4 times. Remove lid of food processor and spritz surface of mixture thoroughly with water. Replace lid and pulse 5 times. Add more water and pulse again until mixture holds together when squeezed.

  title: Grilled Cheese Sandwich (Alton Brown)
  ingredients: "There are times (your team just lost by a lousy field goal) when our appetites should be free to comfort us without having to bow to the culinary censorship of our consciousness. What could possibly get us through the winters of our discontent like the warm embrace of melted cheese nestled between perfectly crisped bookends of toast. That\xE2\x80\x99s right: nothing.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    2 slices of bread, cut thin (as far as bread selection goes, all I'll say is the bigger the loaf the bigger the sandwich)\r\n\
    1 teaspoon (or more) smooth Dijon mustard\r\n\
    1 cup Grated cheese (This is the soul of the thing, so use the good stuff. We like a semi-hard, semi-soft combo like smoked gouda and Gruyere or Fontina with a young Asiago. If you're a purist , go for the Cheddar, but make it sharp and aged if possible.\r\n\
    Good quality olive oil for spritzing."
  directions: |-
    Find 2 heavy skillets that will nest together. Two (10-inch) cast iron skillets are ideal. Heat them over high heat.
    
    Meanwhile, spread mustard on one slice of bread. Distribute the cheese evenly over the mustard, season with fresh black pepper and top with second piece of bread.
    
    Spritz the bread surface that's staring up at you with olive oil using either a Misto or a pump sprayer. A light coat will do, don't soak.
    
    When the pans are hot enough to vigorously sizzle a drop of water, remove them from the heat and place the sandwich, top-side down in the middle of one pan. (if your pans are a different size, this would be the smaller one.) Spritz the slice now facing you, as well as the bottom of the other skillet. Lay the skillet right on top of the sandwich. If the top pan isn't cast iron, weigh it down with a brick, can, or something of similar heft.
    
    Wait patiently, crack a beer. When you hear the first bit of cheese run out and sizzle on the pan, it's done. This will take anywhere from 3 to 5 minutes.
    
    Carefully remove the top skillet, (you may need to coax it off with a spatula, but I doubt it). Just look at it. It's perfect...better than mom's. (no reason to tell her)
    
    Remove to a plate, count to 10 and slice it in half. Take a bite. Take another. So they lost... there's always next year.

    2 whole slabs pork baby back ribs
    
    Dry Rub:
    8 tablespoons light brown sugar, tightly packed
    3 tablespoons kosher salt
    1 tablespoon chili powder
    1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
    1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper

    1/2 teaspoon rubbed thyme
    1/2 teaspoon onion powder
    
    Braising Liquid:
    1 cup white wine
    2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
    2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
    1 tablespoon honey
    2 cloves garlic, chopped
  directions: |-
    Preheat oven to 250 degrees.
    
    In a bowl, combine all dry ingredients and mix well. Place each slab of baby back ribs on a piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil, shiny side down. Sprinkle each side generously with the dry rub. Pat the dry rub into the meat. Refrigerate the ribs for a minimum of 1 hour. In a microwavable container, combine all ingredients for the braising liquid. Microwave on high for 1 minute.
    
    Place the ribs on a baking sheet. Open one end of the foil on each slab and pour half of the braising liquid into each foil packet. Tilt the baking sheet in order to equally distribute the braising liquid. Braise the ribs in the oven for 2 1/2 hours.
    
    Transfer the braising liquid into a medium saucepot. Bring the liquid to a simmer and reduce by half or until of a thick syrup consistency. Brush the glaze onto the ribs. Place under the broiler just until the glaze caramelizes lightly. Slice each slab into 2 rib bone portions. Place the remaining hot glaze into a bowl and toss the rib portions in the glaze.
    
    *This recipe makes several batches of dry rub. If more rub is needed, it can be extended by any amount, as long as the ratio of 8:3:1:1 remains the same.

    Heat a gas or charcoal grill with a lid big enough to accommodate the bird. Put a drip pan below the grates.
    
    Mix the ingredients for the Spice Rub until they are well blended. (This will keep, covered, in the refrigerator for 1 week.) Rub it all over the chicken, inside and out.
    
    Open the beer and take a big swig or just pour out a couple of ounces. Sit the chicken on the beer can so the legs are at the bottom and the wings are at the top. Stand the beer can on the grates over the drip pan. Put the cover on and cook over indirect heat until the juices run clear, about 1 hour. (If using charcoal, push the coals to 1 side so the chicken is not over direct heat.)
    
    Note: This chicken can also be cooked in a 350 degrees F oven. Just stand the beer can in a shallow roasting pan and cook about 1 hour or until juices run clear.
